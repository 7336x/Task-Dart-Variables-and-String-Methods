# Variables 🧶

Create some variables to define your `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `height`.

Then, print these variables.

Example for John, Doe, 24, 1.78, the console log should read:

```
John
Doe
24
1.78
```

### 🍋 booleans

Create another variable called `married` which it's value is either `true` or `false`.
